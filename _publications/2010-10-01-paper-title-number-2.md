excerpt: 'This paper analyzes diversity of appointments to corporate boards using panel data for S&P 1500 firms from 2000Q1 to 2019Q4. Using a logistic model with two-way fixed effects and a bias correction, we evaluate the extent to which a boardâ€™s composition and the demographic characteristics of outgoing directors are associated with the appointment of diverse directors in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity.'
