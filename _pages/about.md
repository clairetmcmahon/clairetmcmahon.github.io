I am a Research Professional at University of Chicago's Market Shaping Accelerator. I support the work of Professors Rachel Glennerster, President of the Center for Global Development, Michael Kremer, 2019 Nobel Laureate, and Christopher Snyder. My work focused on designing pull funding market shaping mechanisms to incentivize innovation for global health and pandemic preparedness priorities.
