I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in economics at Harvard. I previously worked as a research professional at the University of Chicago [Market Shaping Accelerator](https://marketshaping.uchicago.edu/) (MSA). At MSA, my research focuses on designing market shaping mechanisms to incentivize innovation for global health and pandemic preparedness priorities. I graduated from Dartmouth College with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics.
